# Back Country Navigation for the Hunter

This series of essays written by Duck Blust, Jr. was originally [published on
Kifaru's website][1] in mid-2004. They detail a navigation system utilizing
map, compass and GPS, with a focus on the UTM coordinate system. Although
written for the back country hunter, the system outlined is applicable to any
wilderness traveller.

It is the best instruction I have encountered for back country navigation, and
is something that I have referenced frequently since its publication. In 2011 I
was able to attend a class with the author, which was organized by members of
the [Kifaru Forums][2].

Years ago I had printed out a hard-copy that I kept in a binder. Wanting to
replace that with an e-reader friendly version, I have formatted the text as
Markdown, suitable for processing via [Pandoc][3]. I have cleaned the essays
slightly, fixing some typos, making the formatting more consistent, and
inserting a small number of footnotes to point to useful resources which have
appeared since the initial writing.
