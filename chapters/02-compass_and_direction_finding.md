# Compass and Direction Finding

Before there was GPS, there was map and compass.

Map and compass are an integral part of a comprehensive approach to back country navigation and, at the same time, the *right* compass provides a means for position plotting, either as a stand-alone or as backup in the event of GPS failure or loss.

As the essay moves along, instructions will be provided that are specific for each of the three compasses recommended, first in direction finding, and later in position plotting.

## Compass Selection

There are a lot of compasses out there on the market, and they range from the meticulously crafted to the downright useless. Fortunately, the best choices for the hunter can be boiled down considerably. The key factors are accuracy, durability, and *night operation capability*. I put special emphasis on night capability because for a serious hunter the ability to navigate before dawn and after dark are absolutes. The top choices in order of expense:

### British Prismatic Compasses

The British prismatics are top of the line, and their price tags -- usually about $400 to $450 -- reflect it. Both manufacturers -- [SIRS Navigation](http://www.sirs.co.uk) and [Pyser-SGI](http://www.pyser-sgi.com) -- are located in Kent, near London. SIRS calls their compass the Model G150 Prismatic Marching Compass and Pyser-SGI markets theirs as the Francis Barker M-73 or M-88, but they're virtually identical to each other in terms of design and features, including sight readings down to 1/4 degree under ideal conditions. The Francis Barker M-73 and the SIRS Model G150 weigh in at about 7.4 ounces. This is due to a lot of brass in their construction, plus they're fluid-dampened. At 4.4 ounces, the Francis Barker M-88 is the lightweight version of the M-73 with less brass and more aluminum in the design. Otherwise, its features, accuracy, etc., are identical to those of the M-73

![Francis Barker M-73](figures/12.jpg)

These British prismatic compasses are the contemporary versions of what the Brits have been using, with constant improvement and refinement, since the Boer War. Fitted with five tiny Tritium lamps, they are not only extremely accurate but are completely functional in even total darkness. Though pricey, they're worth every nickel.

**Note: There are many cheap knockoffs of these compasses in circulation, manufactured mostly in the Middle East. Exercise caution if you're not buying yours directly from the manufacturer or a reputable dealer.**

## Model 27 United States Military Lensatic Compass

Manufactured since 1992 by [Cammenga](http://www.cammenga.com), this compass has been official American military issue for decades. Durable and accurate, though not as "finely tuned" as its British cousins, the Model 27 is a good compass that runs about $90 in the tritium-illuminated version. (There is a conventionally-illuminated, non-tritium version for about $30 less, but my advice is to stick with the tritium.) Prior to Cammenga, these were made by a firm called Stocker & Yale in New Hampshire; these units will be so marked and are just as good as the Cammengas. Weight: 5.3 ounces. (See Figure 13.)

**Note: There seems to be an endless supply of lame lensatic compasses on the market running from $10 to $25 or so. Do yourself a favor and stick with the real thing made by either Cammenga or Stocker & Yale.**

![Model 27 US Military Lensatic](figures/13.jpg)

## Brunton Model 54LU Combi

An extremely clever, reliable, and accurate design that combines precise prismatic sight readings -- down to 0.5 of a degree -- with the features of a baseplate orienteering compass, all for about $76.00. Though it's luminous -- operating in the dark, you have to give it a "flashlight shot" from time to time -- it's not fitted with tritium lights, though there's a Silva version marketed in Australia that is.

A product of [Brunton](http://www.brunton.com) of Riverton, Wyoming, the Combi also features a magnifier and 1:25,000, 1:50,000 and 1:63,360 UTM map scales built into the baseplate. Weight: 1.4 ounces.

![Brunton Model 54LU Combi](figures/14.jpg)

There are other night-friendly compasses on the market made by Brunton, Silva, Suunto, and others, but I've used these three extensively and recommend them highly for hunters.

(I'd be remiss if I didn't make an observation at this point. It is often the case with equipment that cheaper means poorer quality, but that is not so here. The Brunton Combi represents an ingenious design that is multi-functional yet extremely light in weight -- a great instrument. If I were starting from scratch today, I'd go with this one.)

## Expressing Direction

A means of expressing direction that is accurate and precise is essential, and for this we use the compass rose. A simplified compass rose is shown in Figure 15 and depicts the cardinal directions -- north, south, east, west -- and the semi-cardinals -- northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest. Also shown are the compass headings for these points, expressed in degrees:

![A Simplified Compass Rose](figures/15.jpg)

Direction   Degrees
---------   -------
North       0 or 360
Northeast   45
East        90
Southeast   135
South       185
Southwest   225
West        270
Northwest   315

For the precision we need, the compass rose is further divided up into a full circle of 360 degrees, starting at north and moving clockwise, as shown in Figure 16. It is by this means that your GPS, map plot, and compass will express directions. (Your GPS, for instance, will tell you that your downed buck deer is 2.8 miles away on a heading of 268 degrees, or camp is 3.7 miles from your position on a heading of 135 degrees.)

![A Precise Compass Rose](figures/16.jpg)

(There is a second direction system those with a military background will probably have encountered: mils. Within this system, a full circle of 360 degrees is replacedwith a circle of 6400 mils. North is 0000 or 6400 mils, east becomes 1600 mils, south is 3200 mills, west is 4800 mils, and so on. Any GPS can be set to use mils instead of degrees, and the M27 military lensatic compass is dual-graduated to permit the use of either degrees or mils. In any event, the drill is exactly the same -- you're simply substituting mils for degrees -- but for simplicity's sake I recommend that hunters stick with degrees.)


## The Three Norths

There are three norths to deal with in back country navigation: Magnetic, True, and Grid. The differences between the three are vital and can appear complicated, but, as we will see, are readily reduced to a single one- or two-digit number that we will be dialing into our navigation formula.

Magnetic North is, of course, what makes your compass work. Magnetic compasses "point" to the Magnetic North Pole -- that point where the earth's magnetic field is directed vertically downward -- providing a vital point of reference for the navigator. Presently located near the islands of northern Canada's Arctic Archipelago, it is about 600 miles from the True North Pole, that northernmost point on Earth where all meridians of longitude meet.

Magnetic North, then, is that line extending from any given position on the planet (or your topographic map) to the Magnetic North Pole.

True North is that line extending from any given position on the planet (or your topographic map) to the True North Pole. Lines of longitude, then, by definition, represent True North and actually *are* True North. Hence the east- and west-side map borders of every "store bought" topographic map are True North, because they are actual lines (meridians) of longitude.

Lines of Grid North are established by UTM and run very close to True North -- they're usually within only a few degrees -- but are not the same. The difference is a built-in because of UTM's core feature -- instead of a spherical grid system (Lat-Lon) being applied to a flat surface, it's a flat grid system for a flat surface - hence creating a difference between True North and Grid North.

The difference between True North and Magnetic North or the difference between Grid North and Magnetic North at any point on Earth or for the area of any topographic map, expressed in degrees, is called "declination." Along a meandering line called the Agonic Line extending roughly -- very roughly -- up along the length of the Mississippi River, continuing up into Canada through Ontario, Manitoba, Nunavut, and points north, Magnetic North and True North are one and the same: declination is zero.

If you're west of that line, however, declination is east because Magnetic North is east of True North. If you're east of the Agonic Line, the opposite is true: declination is west because Magnetic North is west of True North. For Gannett Peak, Wyoming, for example, true to magnetic declination is 13 degrees east. The summit of Little Round Top at the Gettysburg battlefield in Pennsylvania is 11 degrees west declination, true to magnetic.

A given map's declination is most often identified with a declination diagram on the map itself, as seen in Figure 17, a declination diagram drawn up for Gannett Peak, and in Figure 18, drafted for Little Round Top.

True North is usually identified with a star and/or an "N," Magnetic North with an "M" or "MN" and/or an arrow, and Grid North with a "G" or "GN," as depicted in Figures 17 and 18.

![Declination for Gannet Peak](figures/17.jpg)

![Declination for Little Round Top](figures/18.jpg)

Why the fuss? The issue is accuracy. Consider this formula:

*One degree of compass or map error equals nearly 100 feet of ground error per mile*.

To put this "error formula" into context, let's say you're hunting the Gannett Peak area and ignore the area's true-to-magnetic declination of 13 degrees east, as shown in Figure 17. Those 13 degrees of error result in 1,300 feet (over 400 yards) of error for every mile traveled; you'll be just under a mile off for every four miles covered. It's better, much better, to be as accurate as possible.

Because our maps generated by Terrain Navigator are UTM-gridded and thus the north-south lines that appear on the grid are Grid North, we use grid-to-magnetic declination rather than true-to-magnetic declination.

Figure 19 reflects a typical declination likely to be encountered in Wyoming or Colorado, with magnetic declination being 14 degrees east and grid declination being 2 degrees east of True North. What we're after is our grid-to-magnetic declination, so in this instance we subtract the true-to-grid declination of 2 degrees from the true-to-magnetic declination of 14 degrees for a grid-to-magnetic declination of 12 degrees east.

![Typical Declination in Wyoming or Colorado](figures/19.jpg)

Figure 20 could represent locations in some parts of Idaho or Washington, with magnetic declination being 19 degrees east and grid declination being 2 degrees *west* of True North. What we're after is our grid-to-magnetic declination, so in this instance we *add* the grid-to-true declination of 2 degrees to the true-to-magnetic declination of 19 degrees for a grid-to-magnetic declination of 21 degrees east.

![Declination in Idaho or Washington](figures/20.jpg)

In Figure 21 and Figure 22, we've moved east of the Mississippi -- what's more to the point, east of the Agonic Line.

Figure 21 reflects a typical declination encountered, perhaps, in West Virginia, with magnetic declination being 12 degrees west and grid declination being 2 degrees west of True North. What we're after is our grid-to-magnetic declination, so in this instance we subtract the true-to-grid declination of 2 degrees from the true-to-magnetic declination of 12 degrees for a grid-to-magnetic declination of 10 degrees west.

![Declination in West Virginia](figures/21.jpg)

Figure 22 represents a location in Maine. Here our magnetic declination is 18 degrees west and our grid declination is 1 degree *east* of True North. What we're after is our grid-to-magnetic declination, so in this instance we *add* the magnetic-to-true declination of 18 degrees to the true-to-grid declination of 1 degree for a grid-to-magnetic declination of 19 degrees west.

![Declination in Maine](figures/22.jpg)

The key to arriving at the correct grid-to-magnetic declination is to look carefully at the declination diagram and visualize what you're doing as you do the math -- it helps a lot.

## Determining Correct Declination

Virtually every topographic map has its own declination diagram printed on it, and for generations it's been an article of faith to use the declination it indicates. This approach, unfortunately, is problematic.

First, many topos, particularly the "provisional editions," do not provide Magnetic North or Grid North declinations at all, only a True North line. Others will indicate True North and Magnetic North, but not Grid North. And to make things worse, many of the declination diagrams printed on the maps are inaccurate. This inaccuracy stems from the fact that the Magnetic North Pole moves, and moves constantly at a rate of about 24 miles per year. In the decades since a particular map was printed, it may have shifted hundreds of miles, thus affecting declination in most areas. (The topo maps for most of southwest Wyoming, for instance, are about 3 degrees off.)

Fortunately, there are remedies. The first is on the Internet at [Topozone](http://www.topozone.com), a wonderful map site offering a host of features. Once at the site, all you need do to determine a current, accurate grid-to-magnetic and true-to-magnetic declination for any given area in the U.S. is tap in the name of a city, town, river, creek, lake, summit, or other landmark. TopoZone will seek it out, provide a small map window showing the landmark, and indicate the declinations, as shown in Figure 23.[^2]

![Declination provided by TopoZone](figures/23.jpg)

Another solution is your GPS, which can be set for either True, Grid, or Magnetic, depending on the make and/or model. Once your unit has locked on, it can be used to determine the declination at its location. Garmins and newer Magellans simply indicate the declination; with an older Magellan, note the bearing to any stored landmark with your unit set on "True" then change it to "Magnetic" and check the bearing to the same landmark again -- the difference is your declination.

## Compass Deviation

Electrical sources and metal objects with magnetic properties such as steel or iron can influence your compass; power lines in particular nearly always have a serious affect. (This influence on your compass is commonly referred to as deviation.) The chart below provides the minimum distance you need to be from any of these objects to avoid deviation issues.

Object         Minimum Distance
------------   ----------------
Power Lines    60 meters/yards
Vehicles       25 meters/yards
Wire Fences    10 meters/yards
Rifle          1 meter/yard

## Direction Finding: Compass and GPS

Now that we've worked our way through the "Three Norths" and covered compass deviation, we can begin making some practical applications in handling compass and GPS in conjunction for direction finding.

Some compasses are "declination adjustable;" that is, you can set them according to the True-to-Magnetic or Grid-to-Magnetic declination in the area of your map. The compasses that have been recommended, however -- the British prismatics, the lensatic M-27, and the Brunton Combi -- *are not declination adjustable*. This is not a drawback or a shortcoming, it's simply an element of their design and actually simplifies things when using them in conjunction with a GPS.

The key point is this: your GPS's "North Reference" setting must always match your compass. Since our compasses are "magnetic only," your GPS must be set on "Magnetic" for its "North Reference." (Conversely, if you were working with a declination adjustable compass set for True North, you would want your GPS's "North Reference" setting to be "True North.")

I like to use examples in my training seminars, so let's use one here. You're on a Wyoming elk hunt and the UTM coordinates for your camp on Soda Fork in the Teton Wilderness are `12 05 74 073 E`, `48 69 416 N`. You've got an elk down in a meadow on a timbered bench at `12 5 73 118 E`, `48 68 939 N`, and you've plotted both on your topo map (see Figure 24). (This, by the way, is a good habit to get into; that is, plotting important points on your map as you go instead of just saving them in your GPS and letting it go at that -- it can pay big dividends later.

![Camp and Downed Elk](figures/24.jpg)

Your bull is cleaned out and cooling and it's time to head for camp, which your GPS tells you is a little over a kilometer (about 6/10s of a mile) away on a bearing of 051 degrees magnetic. (See Figure 25.) Follow that bearing -- 051 magnetic -- for just over a kilometer and you'll reach camp. Here is where we start to use compass and GPS in conjunction, because how you cover that 6/10s of a mile on a magnetic heading of 051 degrees magnetic is very important.

First -- and always -- examine your map to check the situation along your planned line of travel from "Point A" to "Point B;" in this instance, from the point marked "Elk" to the point marked "Camp." Cliffs, steep draws, and big, boggy meadows are nice things to know about before you encounter them, especially in the dark. And if there are such obstacles, use your map, compass and GPS to navigate your way around them.

A GPS-only approach requires you to leave the unit on just about the entire way, your eyes fixed on the screen most of the time as you constantly adjust your direction of travel -- your heading -- to keep yourself on course. This simply isn't practical and can easily be dangerous, especially at night. There's a much better way: I like to call it the "Turn It On, Turn It Off" approach to GPS-compass direction finding.

You've turned your GPS on and determined your bearing back to camp -- 051 degrees magnetic. Next you turned your GPS off and studied your planned route, as shown in Figure 25; no apparent roadblocks; you can pretty much "straight line" this one.

![Planned Route of 051 degrees magnetic](figures/25.jpg)

You've determined that the bearing to camp is 051 degrees, and that bearing will now become your heading/course. (Throughout the essay I'll refer to "course" and "heading" -- both of which mean your direction of travel -- as "heading/course." The reason for this is most GPS's refer to your direction of travel as your "heading," while a few call it "course." This way we know we're talking about the same thing.)

The next step is to put your heading/course of 051 degrees magnetic on your British prismatic, U.S. Military M27, or Brunton Combi compass.

## British Prismatic Compasses

Open the compass lid and extend the lid until it is parallel with the main compass body, as shown in Figure 26.

![Lid Parallel to Compass Body](figures/26.jpg)

Note that the index ring is graduated clockwise through 360 degrees. Every 10 degrees are numbered, as indicated, with a five-degree mark in between each numbered graduation. Between each five-degree mark, you can readily "eyeball" single graduations (single degrees); in addition, when the index ring clamp screw is backed off slightly from a tightened position, the index ring clicks audibly in graduations of 1.5 degrees.

Loosen the index ring clamp screw and turn the index ring to 51 degrees by setting the "51" along the index line (also called the "lubber's line"), then tighten the index ring clamp screw. Note that there is a short luminous line on the index ring's glass face and another short luminous line on the compass card's north marking. (Figure 27.)

![Setting 051 Degrees & Aligning](figures/27.jpg)

With the compass held level at belt level, lid pointing away, as shown in Figure 27A, turn the entire body until both luminous lines are aligned. (See Figure 28.)

The lid's luminous direction-of-travel line is now pointing along a heading/course of 051 degrees magnetic. Camp is along this imaginary direction-of-travel line, about 6/10s of a mile away.

![Direction of Travel Pointing at 051 Degrees](figures/28.jpg)

Now, it's no more practical to walk along staring at a compass dial then it is to try the same thing with a GPS. Instead, we use what the military calls "steering marks."

With the compass set and aligned on 051 as described, you look ahead along the line extending from the direction-of-travel line in the compass lid to a specific landmark -- a distinctively-shaped tree, rock, or rock outcropping, for instance -- this is your steering mark. Close the compass, and walk to the steering mark you selected. Once there, the process is repeated as many times as necessary until you reach camp.

A couple of observations here. Naturally, you'll seldom be able to travel in an absolutely straight line the entire way; there will be times when you'll be compelled to depart from your straight-line heading/course, sometimes by quite a way. When this occurs, simply fire up your GPS, get a new bearing to camp (or whatever your objective is), and begin the process again.

Second observation. It's best to use steering marks that are *between* you and your objective; that way, if you have to depart from your base heading/course for a time, it doesn't matter, because you'll be picking it up again once you reach the mark. If, on the other hand, you use a steering mark that's *beyond* your objective -- a distinctive peak or point on a ridgeline, for instance -- you'll need to use your GPS to check your correct course/heading more often.

Using a British prismatic, the whole process is equally workable in darkness. Prismatics are fitted with five tiny Tritium lamps that glow 24-7 and need no "flashlight shot." The lamps are positioned so that the entire process - putting the heading/course on the index ring, locking it in with the index ring clamp screw, determining the direction of travel, etc. -- can all be done in total darkness without any additional light source. Covering the ground is a much slower process, of course; your steering marks, by necessity, are usually much closer and you're hiking by flashlight (used sparingly). On the other hand, moonlight can provide a surprising amount of navigation light, especially when there's snow on the ground. In any event, it's important to factor in a lot more hiking time to reach an objective and to *be patient*; simply take it one leg at a time, move deliberately and carefully, and accept the fact that it's going to take longer to get there.

## Model 27 United States Military Lensatic Compass

Open the compass lid and extend the lid to its fullest; when so extended it is parallel with the main compass body, as shown. (Refer to Figure 29.) Move the lens/rear sight to its rearmost position, which will allow the compass card to float freely. (The M-27 is not liquid-dampened, as are the British prismatics and the Brunton Combi.)

![Lid Parallel to Compass Body & Align the Compass](figures/29.jpg)

The M-27's compass card is graduated in degrees along its inner edge and in mils along the outer edge. The degree graduations run clockwise through 360 degrees in 5-degree increments; single-degree readings have to be "eyeball estimated."

With the compass held level at belt level, lid pointing away, as shown in Figure 29a, turn the entire body until our heading/course of 051 degrees can be read on the compass card directly beneath the black index line, (also called the "lubber's line"), as shown in Figure 30. Note that there is a short luminous line on the index ring's glass face and another short luminous line on the compass card's North marking.

![Setting 051 Degrees](figures/30.jpg)

While holding the compass in place, reading 051 degrees, rotate the index ring until both luminous lines are aligned, as shown in Figure 31.

![Direction of Travel Pointing at 051 Degrees](figures/31.jpg)

The lid's luminous direction-of-travel line is now pointing along a heading/course of 051 degrees magnetic. Camp is along this imaginary direction-of-travel line, about 6/10s of a mile away.

Now, it's no more practical to walk along staring at a compass dial then it is to try the same thing with a GPS. Instead, we use what the military calls "steering marks"

With the compass set and aligned on 051 as described, you look ahead along the line extending from the direction-of-travel line in the compass lid to a distinctive landmark -- a distinctively-shaped tree, rock, or rock outcropping, for instance -- this is your steering mark. Close the compass, and walk to the steering mark you selected. Once there, the process is repeated as many times as necessary until you reach camp.

A couple of observations here. Naturally, you'll seldom be able to travel in an absolutely straight line the entire way; there will be times when you'll be compelled to depart from your straight-line heading/course, sometimes by quite a way. When this occurs, simply fire up your GPS, get a new bearing to camp (or whatever your objective is), and begin the process again.

Second observation. It's best to use steering marks that are *between* you and your objective; that way, if you have to depart from your base heading/course for a time, it doesn't matter, because you'll be picking it up again once you reach the mark. If, on the other hand, you use a steering mark that's *beyond* your objective -- a distinctive peak or point on a ridgeline, for instance -- you'll need to use your GPS to check your correct course/heading more often.

Putting a course/heading on an M-27 in total darkness is a very risky proposition; it's just too difficult to read the numbers on the compass card and too easy to make mistakes. You'll need to set the compass while there's still some daylight or use a flashlight, being very certain that the flashlight isn't causing any deviation problems. Once it's set, the M-27 works well in darkness. Its other main drawback is that its index ring can't be clamped down like the British prismatics, but this seldom presents a problem.

If your M-27 is the Tritium version, it's luminous 24-7. If it's conventionally luminous, you'll need to give it a "flashlight shot" once in a while.

## Brunton Model 54LU Combi

Refer to Figure 32 and note that the Combi's index ring is graduated clockwise through 360 degrees. Every 20 degrees are numbered, with graduations every two degrees. (The degree graduations are coarse enough to easily set "by eyeball" individual (single) degrees between the two-degree graduations.)

![Bruntom Model 54LU Combi Index Ring](figures/32.jpg)

Turn the index ring to 51 degrees, as indicated, setting "51" along the index line (also called the "lubber's line"), as shown in Figure 33.

![Setting 051 Degrees & Align the Compass](figures/33.jpg)

With the compass held level at belt level, direction-of-travel arrow/line pointing out, as shown in Figure 33a, turn the entire body until the red "Magnetic North" needle (with the white "N") on the compass card is aligned with the red "North" arrow on the index dial, as shown in Figure 34.

The Combi's luminous direction-of-travel arrow/line is now pointing along a heading/course of 051 degrees magnetic. Camp is along this imaginary direction-of-travel line, about 6/10s of a mile away.

![Direction of Travel Pointing at 051 Degrees](figures/34.jpg)

(Note that when the red "Magnetic North" needle on the compass card is aligned with the red "North" arrow on the index dial, the luminous dot on the "Magnetic North" needle is positioned between the two luminous dots on both sides of the "North" arrow on the index dial. In addition, there is a luminous patch beneath the index line (also called the "lubber's line"). These luminous points make the Combi completely functional in the dark, once it's been given a "flashlight shot.")

Now, it's no more practical to walk along staring at a compass dial then it is to try the same thing with a GPS. Instead, we use what the military calls "steering marks"

With the compass set and aligned on 051 as described, you look ahead along the line extending from the direction-of-travel arrow/line on the compass baseplate to a specific landmark -- a distinctively-shaped tree, rock, or rock outcropping, for instance -- this is your steering mark. Walk to the steering mark you selected. Once there, the process is repeated as many times as necessary until you reach camp.

A couple of observations here. Naturally, you'll seldom be able to travel in an absolutely straight line the entire way; there will be times when you'll be compelled to depart from your straight-line heading/course, sometimes by quite a way. When this occurs, simply fire up your GPS, get a new bearing to camp (or whatever your objective is), and begin the process again.

It's best to use steering marks that are *between* you and your objective; that way, if you have to depart from your base heading/course for a time, it doesn't matter, because you'll be picking it up again once you reach the mark. If, on the other hand, you use a steering mark that's *beyond* your objective -- a distinctive peak or point on a ridgeline, for instance -- you'll need to use your GPS to check your correct course/heading more often.

Using a Combi, the whole process is equally workable in darkness. Though it must be given a "flashlight shot" from time to time to freshen it up, the entire process -- putting the heading/course on the index ring, determining the direction of travel, etc. -- can all be done in total darkness without any additional light source. Covering the ground is a much slower process, of course; your steering marks, by necessity, are usually much closer and you're hiking by flashlight (used sparingly).
